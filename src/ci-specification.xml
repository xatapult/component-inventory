            <p>A Darlington transistor—also known as a Darlington pair—is an electronic device that combines two bipolar junction transistors so that
              the current amplified by the first is further amplified by the second, resulting in an exceptionally high overall current gain and
              allowing a very small input current to control a much larger output current. In this configuration, the emitter of the first transistor
              feeds the base of the second, and both collectors are typically tied together, making the pair behave like a single transistor with one
              base, one collector, and one emitter. </p>

        <p>A MOS-FET (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor) is a voltage-controlled semiconductor device that uses an insulated gate to

          gate is separated from the conducting channel by a thin oxide layer, so applying a voltage creates an electric field that either enables or

      <description>
        <p>A thyristor is a four-layer semiconductor device that acts as a solid-state switch, designed to handle high voltages and large currents in
          power-control applications. It remains in a non-conductive “off” state until a small trigger current is applied to its gate, at which point
          it rapidly switches to a conductive “on” state and continues conducting as long as current flows above a certain holding threshold. This
          latching behavior makes thyristors ideal for controlling AC power, such as in motor drives, light dimmers, and controlled rectifiers, where
          precise timing of switching is essential. Their robustness, efficiency, and ability to manage significant electrical loads have made them
          foundational components in power electronics.</p>

      <description>
        <p>A triac is a bidirectional, three-terminal semiconductor device used for controlling AC power, capable of switching current on both halves
          of an AC waveform. Functionally similar to two thyristors connected in opposite directions, it can be triggered into conduction by a small
          gate current regardless of the polarity of the voltage across it. Once turned on, it remains conducting until the current naturally drops
          below its holding level, making it ideal for applications like lamp dimmers, motor-speed controllers, and heater regulation. Its ability to
          modulate power smoothly and efficiently in AC circuits has made the triac a staple component in many household and industrial control
          systems.</p>

        <p>I²C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) is a simple, low-speed, two-wire communication protocol designed for short-distance data exchange between
          chips on the same circuit board. It uses just two shared lines—SDA for data and SCL for the clock—to let multiple “slave” devices
          communicate with one “master” controller without needing separate wiring for each connection. Each device has a unique address, and the
          master controls when data is sent, making the bus efficient and easy to scale. Because it’s lightweight, flexible, and inexpensive to
          implement, I²C is widely used in embedded systems to connect sensors, displays, memory chips, and other peripherals.</p>

        <p>CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) ICs are defined by their extremely low power consumption, high noise immunity, and wide
          operating-voltage range, all made possible by using complementary pairs of p-channel and n-channel MOSFETs that draw almost no current
          except when switching. This design gives CMOS logic excellent energy efficiency, making it ideal for battery-powered and portable devices,
          while also enabling high-density integration for complex digital circuits. CMOS ICs typically offer slower edge speeds than some
          high-performance logic families but compensate with minimal heat generation, strong reliability, and broad applicability across

            <p>A Schmitt trigger is a type of comparator circuit with built-in hysteresis, meaning it uses two different threshold voltages to
              determine when its output switches between high and low states. This dual-threshold behavior prevents rapid, noisy, or slowly changing
              input signals from causing erratic output transitions, making the circuit excellent for cleaning up noisy waveforms, debouncing
              mechanical switches, and converting analog signals into crisp digital pulses. By ensuring that the input must cross a higher threshold
              to switch one way and a lower threshold to switch back, a Schmitt trigger provides stable, predictable switching even in electrically
              noisy environments.</p>

      <description>
        <p>An operational amplifier, or op-amp, is a high-gain differential amplifier designed to compare two input voltages and produce an output
          that reflects their difference, making it one of the most versatile building blocks in analog electronics. With extremely high input
          impedance, very low output impedance, and a large open-loop gain, an op-amp can be configured using external resistors and components to
          perform a wide range of functions such as amplification, filtering, summing, integration, differentiation, and signal conditioning. Because
          of this flexibility and its predictable linear behavior when used with feedback, the op-amp is foundational in audio circuits, sensors,

      <description>
        <p>An optocoupler, also known as an optoisolator, is a device that transfers electrical signals between two isolated circuits using light,
          providing a safe and reliable way to prevent high voltages or electrical noise from passing between them. It typically contains an LED on
          the input side and a light-sensitive component—such as a phototransistor, photodiode, or phototriac—on the output side, all sealed within a
          single package. When the LED turns on, it emits light that activates the output device, allowing the signal to cross the isolation barrier
          without any direct electrical connection. This makes optocouplers essential in protecting microcontrollers, communication interfaces, and
          low-voltage electronics from surges, spikes, and ground-loop issues in power supplies, industrial controls, and switching circuits.</p>

          into smooth, continuous signals, DACs enable microcontrollers, computers, and digital audio systems to drive speakers, control motors,
          generate waveforms, and produce precise analog outputs. Their performance is defined by factors like resolution, sampling rate, linearity,

        <p>A rectifier is an electronic circuit or device that converts alternating current (AC) into direct current (DC), making it essential for
          powering most electronic equipment that requires a steady, one-directional flow of electricity. It works by using diodes—or controlled
          devices like thyristors—to allow current to pass only during specific portions of the AC cycle, effectively blocking the reverse direction.
          Rectifiers come in several forms, such as half-wave, full-wave, and bridge configurations, each offering different levels of efficiency and
          smoothness in the resulting DC output. They are widely used in power supplies, battery chargers, and any system that needs to transform AC

        <p>A voltage comparator is an electronic circuit designed to compare two input voltages and switch its output to a defined high or low state
          depending on which input is greater. Unlike an op-amp, which is optimized for linear amplification, a comparator is built for fast, clean
          transitions and typically operates in saturation, making it ideal for turning analog signals into digital logic levels. When the
          non-inverting input rises above the inverting input, the output snaps to its high state; when it falls below, the output switches low. This
          sharp switching behavior makes comparators essential in applications like threshold detection, zero-crossing detection, waveform shaping,

          monitoring its output and adjusting its internal resistance or switching behavior to compensate for fluctuations, preventing overvoltage or
          undervoltage conditions. Regulators come in linear and switching types: linear regulators provide low noise and simplicity, while switching
          regulators offer higher efficiency and can handle larger voltage differences. They are essential in power supplies for everything from
